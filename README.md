EcoTrack is a comprehensive e-waste management solution that aims to promote sustainable recycling practices. This project was developed by Kartikeydheer Srivastava and Greeva Patel during a hackathon organized by Odoo.

#Project Overview:
EcoTrack provides users with a platform to responsibly dispose of electronic waste (e-waste) and track the environmental impact of their actions. The platform is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, with a Node.js backend to manage user authentication and environmental impact data.

#Features:
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely manage their accounts.

Environmental Impact Tracking: The platform displays key metrics related to e-waste management, such as the amount of bio-medical waste treated, metal recovered, and plastic waste recycled.

Request E-Waste Pickup: Users can request the pickup of e-waste directly from the platform.

Informative Sections: The site educates users on the importance of e-waste recycling and its impact on health and the environment.
